## Installation

Before running the program, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library

You can install OpenCV library by running the following command:

```
pip install opencv-python
```

## Usage

To use the lane detection system, run the following command:

```
python detect_lanes.py <input_file>
```

Where `<input_file>` is the path to the input image or video file.

The output of the program will be displayed in a new window. The detected lanes will be highlighted in green.
